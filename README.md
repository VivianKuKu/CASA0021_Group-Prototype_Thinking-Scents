### 1. The Motivation for the Thinking Scents

The motivation for building Thinking Scents comes from the frustration at having little interactions between the environments and people when using oil diffusers from the current market. For example, current products can't automatically adjust the scents emitted according to real-time environmental conditions. What’s more, there is no oil diffuser that enables users to share the scents they are using right now with the people they care about. As a result, Thinking Scents wants to rebuild the connections between people and their surrounding environments and their beloved ones by choosing and sharing scents automatically.

In addition, although there are several oil diffusers on the market that can allow users to mix up multiple scents at the same time, most of them are either relatively simple in function or expensive in device per se. However, according to research, using different scents in different weather conditions will bring many benefits to people, especially having a positive effect on improving people's mood. That’s why Thinking Scents will offer competitive pricing at £120 per device including allowing two mobile devices to access the App.

### 2. Product

#### 2-1. Physical Device

The physical device accommodates water tanks and the hardware such as ultrasonic mist makers and the Arduino WiFi board together. In order to allow users to mix up the scents they want, there is only one chimney designed that enables steam to diffuse. Users can add one kind of essential oil to at most three water tanks respectively and control the on/off of each mist maker. There is a wall between the room for water tanks and the other one for hardware making sure steam will not influence the electronic parts. All parts (walls, roofs, base) of the enclosure can be taken apart and reassembled.
